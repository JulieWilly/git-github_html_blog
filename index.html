    <!-- What is git  -->
    <div>
        <h2><b>1. What is git</b></h2>
        <p>Git is a version control system, that is used for source code management in software development. A version
            control, also referred to as <i>source control</i>, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software
            code over time in the software development process. Version control helps to track any changes made in the
            code and in a special kind of database. Any mistake that is made, developers can turn back the clock and
            compare ealier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while at the same time minimizing disruption to
            the other developers.
        <ul>
            <p>There are other types of version control in existence include:</p>
            <li>Gitlab</li>
            <li>Bitbucket</li>
            <li>Subversion</li>
            <li>SVN</li>
            <li>Centralized version control and, </li>
            <li>Distributed version control.</li>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <p>In this blog, my focus will be on <em><b>Git</b></em> and <em><b>Github</b></em> as a control version.

    <!-- Installing git -->

    <div>
        <h2><b>2. Installing git</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Before you begin to use Git, first check whether is installed in your machine. To check if Git is installed
                in your machine type the command <b>git</b> in your command prompt. If you see git usage screen then it is
                already installed. 
            <li><p>If Git is not installed in your local machine, <i>follow this link to the official website and download Git for your respective operating system</i> <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Download Git</a>and install it.</p></li>
            <li><p>To check if Git has been installed and its version, type the command <b>git --version</b> as shown in the below.<p></p></li>

    <!-- configuring git  -->
    <div>
        <h2><b>3. Configuring Git</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Git comes with a tool called <em><strong>git config</strong></em> that lets you get and set configuration variables such as <i>(user email address and user name)</i> that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. The <em><strong>git config</strong></em> command is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project. <br>
                Run the command below to configure your email address as follows.
            </p>

                <figcaption><i>fig:- </i> How to configure users name.</figcaption></li>
            <li><p>If any error is made when configuring either the user name or the email address, you can rewrite the command with the correct user name or email address. The previously written name or email address will be overwritten with the correct one. <br> Notably, you can check the configured name or email address using the commands as follows:</p>

    <!-- Initializing a git repository -->
    <div>
        <h2><b>4. Intializing a Git repository</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>A Git repository is a central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. Itis a crucial component of Git verson control which enable collaborative development and facilitating efficient and controlled code management. A Git repository stores all the versions of files within a project, enabling developers to track changes, collaborate, and easily revert to previous versions if needed.</p>

        <ol>
            <p><b>Steps on how to initialize a git repository.</b></p>
            <li><p>Create a folder in your local disk for storing project files.</p></li>
            <li><p>Open the command prompt from the folder.</p></li>
            <li><p>Check if the folder is already inintialized for git. Type the command <em>git status</em> in the command prompt as shown below.</p></li>

        <h2><b>5. Adding files to the staging area</b></h2>
        <p><b>What is a staging area?</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Git staging area is an intermediate are that stores changes to tracked files before they are committed to the repository. You can add or remove files from the staging area to control which changes are included in the next commit. <br>
                You an add or remove files to the staging area to determine which files you want to push to the repository.</p></li>
            <li> <p>You can add a single file at an instance to the staging area using the command <b>git add <i>filename</i></b>. as demostrated below.</p>

    <!-- Commiting changes -->
    <div>
        <h2><b>6. Commiting changes.</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The command <b>git commit</b> is used to save all staged changes, along with a brief descripiton from the user, in a <i>commit</i> to the local repository.</li>
            <li> A commit basically acts as a snapshot of your project, where a new version of that projecy is created in the current repository.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <b>-m</b> option stands for a message. When calling the <b>git commit</b> command it is crucial to include a description of the changes being committed. The message should be wrapped in quotations <b>(" ")</b>.</p></li>
            <li><b>git commit -m <i>"commit message"</i></b></li>
            <p><b><br>Tracking commit history</b></p>
            <li>The command <b>git log</b> is used to display all the commits in a repository's history. It helps developers list the project history, filter it, and search for a specific changes.</li>
            <img src="assets/gitLog.JPG" width="800px" alt="git log.">
            <figcaption><i>fig:- </i> Using <b>git log</b>  command to list the history all commits.</figcaption>
            <br><li>The commands <b>git log --oneline</b> is used to condence the lengthy <b>git log</b> output into a single line, well formatted output of the commits. The command only displays the commit ID and the first line of the commit message as shown below.</li>

        <h4>Guideliness on how to write a good commit messages.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Obey the 50-character limit for the subject line.</li>
            <li>Capitalize just the first letter in the subject line.</li>
            <li>Do not place a period at the end of the subject line.</li>
            <li>Place a blank line between the subject line and the body of the message.</li>
            <li>Limit the message body width to 72 characters.</li>

    <div>
        <h2><b>7. Branches</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>In Git, a branch is a new separate versionof the main repository. Branches allow working on different parts of the project, such as <i>fixing a specific error in a file.</i> without interfering with the main branch. When the work on the newly created branch is complete, the branch is merged with the main project to implement the changes made.</p>
            <li><p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.</p>

    <h2><b>Recommendation.</b></h2>
    <p>I higly appreciate you for the dedication of your time to read through my blog. I hope it was informative and of help to you. If there is a concept that I might have left out, or you need some more clarification on a concept, I would recommend you to visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">Git documentation</a> for more guidance. I would also recommend you to interact with other control version I had listed above to have some deeper insights and understanding on version control and the tools used to achieve this. 
    <br>Thank you.</p>
